Scrape conversation on Twitter based on Keywords or Hashtags and perform Sentiment Analysis

Just checking if I could commit the changes in this file to the remote repo.

The Capstone Repo contains a README file with pre-existing headers and bullet points to help guide your thoughts. You are required to fill this file in with a Project Overview. The overview should reflect the structure of your Areas of Interest Submission, explaining the Problem Area, including those affected, your proposed Data Science solution, the impact of your solution, and a description of your dataset. Any changes or refinements to your Area of Interest should be reflected in the README, and it is expected that your description of the data will be more granular (including a Data Dictionary if feasible) compared to the Area of Interest submission.
