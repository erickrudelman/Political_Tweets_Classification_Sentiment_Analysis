# tweet_sentiment_analysis_capstone
Scrape conversation on Twitter based on Keywords or Hashtags and perform Sentiment Analysis

Just checking if I could commit the changes in this file to the remote repo.

The Capstone Repo contains a README file with pre-existing **headers and bullet points** to help guide your thoughts. You are required to fill this file in with a **Project Overview**. The overview should reflect the structure of your:

- *Areas of Interest Submission*:
- *explaining the Problem Area*:
- *including those affected*:
- *proposed Data Science solution*:
- *impact of your solution*:
- *description of your dataset*:

Any changes or refinements to your Area of Interest should be reflected in the README, and it is expected that your description of the data will be more granular (including a Data Dictionary if feasible) compared to the Area of Interest submission.
